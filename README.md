# SAT-44
We need to remember to document: the important design decisions for your SAT solver (both how and why)

## TODO
#### Now (ish)
- Read dimac and construct CNF structure
- Translating sudoku into a CNF readable form
- Basic SAT Solver <- divide into sub-task!!
- Recursive vs iterative (Jade!?!?)
- Decide which heuristics/ type of SAT solver we would like to make.

#### Future
- Create a hypothesis (plus motivation why it is interesting and plausible)
- Your experimental design (which experimental conditions do you test, which test set do you use, which metrics are you measuring, and why)
- Your experimental results (consider including plots or graphs or bar charts, and to test for statistical significance of your results)
- The conclusion about your hypothesis that you draw from your results (and why)
